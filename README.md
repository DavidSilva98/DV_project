# DV_project
The project objective is to use visualization concepts and techniques to transform data into a meaningful interactive dashboard that allows the final user to make well-informed decisions.
The data used in our project comes from Inside Airbnb, a website that provides scrapped data from Airbnb. The data used concerns the Airbnb listings of Lisbon for the month of June 2019. The variablesâ€™ metadata is available under the data folder in the metadata file.
In order to reach our objective, the project was developed and implemented using Python, particularly Plotly with Dash software.
